Describable

- An interface written by Nicholas Vaidyanathan, Lead Visionary of Visionary Software Solutions

Used to adhere to keep things DRY, and add some semantic security by creating a granular interface that has
the bare minimum amount of information needed to describe something: it's name, and a description. Example usage can
be seen in the Spock tests
